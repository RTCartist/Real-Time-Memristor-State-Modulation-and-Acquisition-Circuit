# Real-Time-Memristor-State-Modulation-and-Acquisition-Circuit
Memristive neuromorphic systems are designed to emulate human perception and cognition, where the memristor states represent essential historical information to perform both low-level and high-level tasks. However, current systems face challenges with the separation of state modulation and acquisition, leading to undesired time delays that impact real-time performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce a dual-function circuit that concurrently modulates and acquires memristor state information. This is achieved through two key features: (1) a feedback operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuit that ensures precise voltage application on the memristor while converting the passing current into a voltage signal; (2) a division calculation circuit that acquires state information from the modulation voltage and the converted voltage, improving stability by leveraging the intrinsic
threshold characteristics of memristors. This circuit has been evaluated in a memristor-based nociceptor and a memristor
crossbar, demonstrating exceptional performance. Detailed insights and methodologies are discussed in our manuscript available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00378.
